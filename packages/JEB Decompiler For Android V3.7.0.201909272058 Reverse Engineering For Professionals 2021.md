## What's New in JEB Decompiler for Android v3.7.0.201909272058?
 
According to the official change log[^1^], some of the notable changes in JEB Decompiler for Android v3.7.0.201909272058 are:
 
- Improved Dalvik decompiler: added support for multi-dex APKs, optimized code generation and refactoring, enhanced virtual hierarchy and code cleaning.
- Improved native code decompiler: added support for RISC-V architecture, improved ARM and MIPS decompilation, added more analysis modules and optimizers.
- Improved Android debuggers: added support for seamless debugging of Dalvik and native code, including JNI methods and apps that do not allow debugging.
- Improved UI: added more options for customization, navigation, annotation, and modification of the analysis output.
- Improved API: added more features and documentation for scripting and automation of reverse engineering tasks using Java or Python.

## Why Use JEB Decompiler for Android v3.7.0.201909272058?
 
JEB Decompiler for Android v3.7.0.201909272058 is a powerful tool for reverse engineering Android apps because it offers several advantages over other tools in the market, such as:

- It works on true Dalvik code: unlike other tools that require conversion from Dex to Jar, JEB Decompiler for Android can directly decompile Dalvik bytecode without losing any information or accuracy[^2^].
- It can handle obfuscated code: JEB Decompiler for Android can automatically decrypt, unreflect, and clean up obfuscated code generated by various application protectors[^2^]. It can also reconstruct resources and XML files that have been obfuscated.
- It can debug closed-source apps: JEB Decompiler for Android can debug any app, regardless of whether it allows debugging or not[^1^]. It can also hook sensitive APIs and examine memory contents during debugging.
- It can be extended and automated: JEB Decompiler for Android has a rich API that allows users to write their own scripts, plugins, analysis modules, and optimizers to automate and customize their reverse engineering tasks[^1^].

## How to Get JEB Decompiler for Android v3.7.0.201909272058?
