## Record User Videos and Analytics
 
Another great feature of Indigo Studio is that it enables you to conduct user testing and get real-time reports. You can record user sessions with screen and audio capture, and watch them later with annotations. You can also track task completion time and success rates, as well as click maps and heat maps. You can invite unlimited participants and get unlimited user videos. This way, you can validate your design assumptions and get insights into user behavior and preferences.
