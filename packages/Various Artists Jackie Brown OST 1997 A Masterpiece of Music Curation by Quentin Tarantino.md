The soundtrack album captures the mood and tone of the film, which is a mix of crime drama, romance and comedy. The songs reflect the characters' personalities, emotions and motivations, as well as the themes of betrayal, redemption and survival. The songs also evoke the atmosphere of the 1970s, with references to social issues, street culture and pop culture. Some of the songs are also used as plot devices or foreshadowing elements in the film.
  
Some of the highlights of the soundtrack album are:
  
- "Across 110th Street" by Bobby Womack: This song serves as the opening and closing theme of the film, as well as the title of a 1972 blaxploitation film that Tarantino admires. The song is about the struggles and hardships of living in Harlem, New York.
- "Strawberry Letter 23" by The Brothers Johnson: This song is played during a romantic scene between Jackie Brown (Pam Grier) and Max Cherry (Robert Forster), who bond over their love for vinyl records. The song is a psychedelic funk tune with lyrics that are inspired by a love letter written on strawberry-scented paper.
- "Who Is He (And What Is He to You)?" by Bill Withers: This song is played during a tense scene where Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson) confronts Louis Gara (Robert De Niro) about his affair with Melanie Ralston (Bridget Fonda). The song is a soulful funk track with lyrics that question a lover's fidelity.
- "Long Time Woman" by Pam Grier: This song is sung by Pam Grier herself, who plays the titular character of Jackie Brown. The song is from her 1971 blaxploitation film The Big Doll House, where she plays a prisoner in a women's prison. The song is about a woman who has been incarcerated for a long time and has lost hope.
- "Inside My Love" by Minnie Riperton: This song is played during the end credits of the film, as Jackie Brown drives away with a smile on her face. The song is a sensual soul ballad with lyrics that invite a lover to explore her inner world.

The soundtrack album of Jackie Brown is a must-have for any fan of Tarantino's films or blaxploitation cinema. It is a collection of songs that are timeless, catchy and meaningful. It is also a tribute to some of the greatest artists of soul and funk music, who have influenced generations of musicians and filmmakers.
