The exploit involves using a script that allows the player to collect unlimited tapes, which are collectibles that unlock lore and secrets about the game. The script can be found on various websites, such as rscripts.net and jake11price.weebly.com. The player also needs an exploit tool, such as JJSploit, to execute the script in the game.
 
The exploit works by teleporting the player to all the locations where the tapes spawn, and automatically picking them up. This way, the player can collect all the tapes in a matter of seconds, without having to explore the map or face any dangers. The exploit also bypasses the cooldown timer that normally prevents the player from collecting more than one tape per day.
 
Some players have uploaded videos of themselves using the exploit on YouTube, such as MistTM and Mongo. These videos show how easy it is to use the exploit and how it affects the gameplay. Some players have criticized the exploit for ruining the fun and challenge of the game, while others have defended it as a harmless way to enjoy the game's lore.
 
The developers of The Pizzeria Roleplay: Remastered have not yet addressed the exploit or taken any measures to prevent it. It is unclear whether they are aware of it or not, or whether they plan to patch it in the future. Until then, players who want to play the game fairly and legitimately may have to deal with exploiters who have an unfair edge over them.

The Pizzeria Roleplay: Remastered is based on the Five Nights at Freddy's franchise, a series of horror games created by Scott Cawthon. The games feature animatronic characters that come to life at night and try to kill the player, who works as a security guard at various locations. The games also have a complex and mysterious lore that is revealed through various clues, minigames, and cutscenes.
